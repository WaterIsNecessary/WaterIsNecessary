- 👋 Hi, I’m @WaterIsNecessary.
- 👀 I’m interested in a wide spectre of fields (ranging from front end to back end) but primarily focused on machine learning, the practical and theoretical implementations of it and the mathematics associated with it.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning a wide stack of technologies (web dev, backend, etc) whilst I complete my bachelor in informatics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects soon..
